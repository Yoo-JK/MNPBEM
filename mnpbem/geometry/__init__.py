"""
Geometry and mesh generation module.

Classes:
- Particle: Basic particle with triangular mesh
- ComParticle: Compound particle with multiple materials
- ComParticleMirror: Compound particle with mirror symmetry
- CompStructMirror: Structure for compound with mirror symmetry
- Point: Single collection of points in space
- ComPoint: Compound of points in a dielectric environment
- EdgeProfile: Edge rounding profile for nanostructures
- Polygon: 2D polygon for mesh generation
- Polygon3: 3D polygon for extrusion of particles

Functions:
- trisphere: Generate triangulated sphere
- trirod: Generate triangulated nanorod
- tricube: Generate triangulated nanocube with rounded edges
- tritorus: Generate triangulated torus
- trispheresegment: Generate triangulated sphere segment
- trispherescale: Scale a sphere to create ellipsoid
- tripolygon: Generate 3D particle from 2D polygon + edge profile
- fvgrid: Convert parametric surface to face-vertex structure
- connect: Compute connectivity between particles
